# About the project

![](https://github.com/gustav-evensson/allstore/blob/main/readmeAssets/allstoreThumb.jpg)

AllStore is a project i did solely for my own learning purpose. I tried to implement a few different functions that a had not worked on before. The website is not functional in any other way than visual content. 

I used an API from [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/) to get the products that are show on the page.

I did not put that much time into the design on this project I felt I would rather focus on the functionality of the site.
